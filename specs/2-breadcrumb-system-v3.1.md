## 1. Purpose

### The Problem

Agents build tools, integrations, scripts, and workflows. The next session, they have no memory of what was built, what it does, how to run it, or even that it exists. The operator ends up re-explaining everything, or worse, the agent rebuilds something that already exists.

### The Solution

Every component gets a **breadcrumb** — a structured markdown file that explains exactly what the component is, how it works, and how to use it. All breadcrumbs are cataloged in a **breadcrumb trail** (a central index). A **bread recipe** (capabilities manifest) tells every agent what tools and integrations are available to them before they even start a task. A **Breadcrumb Baker** agent runs periodically to discover undocumented components, validate existing breadcrumbs, and keep the trail current.

### What This Spec Does Not Cover

- Persistent memory, identity evolution, or relationship intelligence (see the OpenClaw Persistent Memory spec if needed)
- Agent deployment infrastructure
- Task orchestration or project management

---

## 2. Design Principles

1. **Breadcrumbs live with their components** (in-situ). The trail is an index, not a copy.
2. **Every agent breadcrumbs what it builds.** The Baker validates and indexes — it does not retroactively document things it didn't build.
3. **The cold start test:** Could an agent with zero prior context use a component with ONLY the breadcrumb and no other information? If not, the breadcrumb is incomplete.
4. **One source of truth.** No duplicate breadcrumbs. The in-situ file is the canonical version.
5. **Capabilities before tasks.** Every agent checks the bread recipe before starting work to know what tools are available.
6. **Token awareness.** Every breadcrumb carries a token estimate so that any token-budgeted system can plan reads before committing context window space.
7. **Extend, don't couple.** This spec works standalone. If a persistent memory system is also active, integration is handled through an external bridge — not through modifications to this spec.
8. **Atomic writes protect data.** *(New in v3.1)* All writes to critical index and recipe files use an atomic write protocol (temp file → move) to prevent corruption from interrupted writes.
9. **Orphans have a lifecycle.** *(New in v3.1)* Auto-drafted orphan breadcrumbs expire after 30 days if not validated, preventing stale clutter from accumulating indefinitely.

## 3. Prerequisites

### Required

| Component | Purpose | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| OpenClaw instance | Agent runtime | Any supported platform |
| Filesystem access | Breadcrumb storage | Agents need read/write to workspace directories |
| Cron scheduling | Baker automation | OpenClaw native |
| `jq` | Index querying | Standard Linux utility |

### Optional (Recommended)

| Component | Purpose | Impact If Absent |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| NFS / shared storage mount | Multi-agent access to breadcrumbs | Single-machine setups work fine without it |
| Multiple agents | Distributed builds | System works with a single agent |

### Infrastructure Notes

- All file paths in this spec are relative to the agent's home directory (`~/` by default).
- The primary breadcrumb trail directory is `~/breadcrumb-trail/`. Operators may symlink this from any workspace path.
- File paths in examples use `~/` notation. Substitute your actual workspace root.

---

## 4. Core Concepts

| Concept | What It Is | File |
|---------|-----------|------|
| **Breadcrumb** | A structured doc for a single component | `{type}.{name}.crumb.md` |
| **Breadcrumb Trail** | Central index of all breadcrumbs | `index.json` + `trail.md` |
| **Bread Recipe** | Capabilities manifest — what can agents do | `recipe.json` |
| **Breadcrumb Baker** | Agent that discovers, validates, indexes | Runs on schedule |
| **Orphan** | A breadcrumb for a component with no home directory | Lives in `orphans/` |

### Component Types

| Type | What It Covers | Examples |
|------|---------------|----------|
| `script` | Shell, Python, Node scripts | Data processors, downloaders, utilities |
| `api` | External API integrations | Gmail API, Telegram auth, Discord gateway |
| `tool` | Standalone applications | Dashboards, web apps, scanners |
| `skill` | OpenClaw skills | Weather skill, email skill |
| `workflow` | Multi-step processes chaining components | Data pipelines, morning briefs |
| `config` | System configurations | Cron jobs, env files, service configs |
| `agent` | Agent definitions and prompts | Any deployed OpenClaw agent |

---

## 5. Naming Convention

### Rules

- **Breadcrumb ID:** `{type}_{component-name}` — underscores between type and name, hyphens within the component name
- **Filename:** `{type}.{component-name}.crumb.md` — dots between segments, `.crumb.md` extension
- **Directory slug:** `{component-name}/` — hyphens only, lowercase

The `.crumb.md` extension is mandatory. It makes breadcrumbs instantly identifiable in any directory listing, `find` command, or grep. It's still valid markdown — any editor renders it fine.

### Examples

| Component | Breadcrumb ID | Filename |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Chat Miner script | `script_chat-miner` | `script.chat-miner.crumb.md` |
| Telegram auth API | `api_telegram-auth` | `api.telegram-auth.crumb.md` |
| Dashboard tool | `tool_dashboard` | `tool.dashboard.crumb.md` |
| Data pipeline workflow | `workflow_data-pipeline` | `workflow.data-pipeline.crumb.md` |
| Gmail access integration | `api_gmail-access` | `api.gmail-access.crumb.md` |
| Content rater script | `script_content-rater` | `script.content-rater.crumb.md` |
| Bot agent | `agent_bot-name` | `agent.bot-name.crumb.md` |
| Morning brief workflow | `workflow_morning-brief` | `workflow.morning-brief.crumb.md` |

## 8. Where Breadcrumbs Live

### Layer 1: In-Situ Breadcrumbs (Source of Truth)

Every component's breadcrumb lives in its own directory, next to the code:

```
~/agents/example-bot/
├── main.py
├── run.sh
├── .env
└── script.example-bot.crumb.md         ← breadcrumb lives here
```

```
~/tools/dashboard/
├── app.py
├── routes/
├── scripts/
├── tool.dashboard.crumb.md             ← parent breadcrumb
└── internals/
    ├── script.fetcher.crumb.md         ← child breadcrumb (independently callable)
    └── script.parser.crumb.md
```

```
~/workflows/data-pipeline/
├── download.sh
├── process.py
├── analyze.py
├── workflow.data-pipeline.crumb.md     ← orchestration breadcrumb
├── script.download.crumb.md            ← step 1
├── script.process.crumb.md             ← step 2
└── script.analyze.crumb.md             ← step 3
```

### Layer 2: Central Hub (Index + Orphans)

The breadcrumb trail directory is the central hub. It contains the index, the recipe, and orphaned breadcrumbs — but NOT copies of in-situ breadcrumbs.

```
~/breadcrumb-trail/
├── index.json                          ← machine-searchable catalog of ALL breadcrumbs
├── index.json.bak                      ← backup of previous index (v3.1: Atomic Write Protocol)
├── recipe.json                         ← capabilities manifest (the Bread Recipe)
├── recipe.json.bak                     ← backup of previous recipe (v3.1: Atomic Write Protocol)
├── trail.md                            ← human-readable summary table
├── schema.crumb.md                     ← THIS SPEC (the system eats its own dogfood)
├── baker.log                           ← Breadcrumb Baker run history
├── orphans/                            ← breadcrumbs for components with no home directory
│   ├── api.service-auth.crumb.md       ← external API, no local code dir
│   ├── api.email-access.crumb.md       ← integration config, no standalone dir
│   └── config.cron-jobs.crumb.md       ← system-level config
└── archive/                            ← deprecated breadcrumbs past retention period
```

### What Goes Where

| Scenario | Breadcrumb Location |
|----------|-------------------|
| Script in ~/scripts/ | In-situ: `~/scripts/{name}/script.{name}.crumb.md` |
| Tool in ~/tools/ | In-situ: `~/tools/{name}/tool.{name}.crumb.md` |
| Agent in ~/agents/ | In-situ: `~/agents/{name}/agent.{name}.crumb.md` |
| External API (no local code) | Orphan: `~/breadcrumb-trail/orphans/api.{name}.crumb.md` |
| System config (cron, env) | Orphan: `~/breadcrumb-trail/orphans/config.{name}.crumb.md` |
| Network-mounted project | In-situ at mount + fallback orphan copy |
| OpenClaw skill | In-situ: `~/.openclaw/skills/{name}/skill.{name}.crumb.md` |

### Network-Mounted Resources

When a component lives on a network share (e.g., `/mnt/shared/projects/example/`):

1. The in-situ breadcrumb lives at the mount: `/mnt/shared/projects/example/workflow.example.crumb.md`
2. A fallback copy lives in orphans: `~/breadcrumb-trail/orphans/workflow.example.crumb.md`
3. The index entry includes `mount_required` and `fallback` fields
4. The Baker checks mount availability during validation and flags when mounts are offline

### 8.1 Orphan Lifecycle & 30-Day Draft Expiration

*(New in v3.1)*

Orphan breadcrumbs — those residing in `~/breadcrumb-trail/orphans/` — follow a managed lifecycle to prevent stale documentation from accumulating indefinitely.

#### The Problem

When the Baker auto-drafts breadcrumbs for discovered components (based on README.md, SKILL.md, or `--help` output), these drafts are placed in `orphans/` with `status: experimental`. Without active validation, these drafts can linger forever — cluttering the index and eroding trust in the system.

#### Lifecycle Rules

1. **30-Day Draft Expiration:** Any orphan breadcrumb with `status: experimental` that was auto-drafted by the Baker expires after **30 days** if not validated (i.e., its status has not been changed to `active` by a human or building agent).

2. **`draft_expires` Field:** When the Baker auto-drafts an orphan, it MUST set the `draft_expires` field in the YAML frontmatter to the creation date + 30 days:
   ```yaml
   status: experimental
   created: 2026-02-22
   draft_expires: 2026-03-24
   ```

3. **Expiration Behavior:** When the Baker encounters an orphan whose `draft_expires` date has passed and whose status is still `experimental`:
   - Move the breadcrumb to `~/breadcrumb-trail/archive/`
   - Set status to `deprecated`
   - Add a changelog entry: `"Auto-expired: draft not validated within 30 days"`
   - Log the expiration in `baker.log`

4. **Validated Orphans Are Exempt:** If an operator or agent has changed the orphan's status to `active`, `broken`, or `deprecated`, the `draft_expires` field is ignored. Only `experimental` (auto-drafted) orphans expire.

5. **`max_orphan_count` Cap:** The system enforces a maximum number of orphan breadcrumbs to prevent unbounded growth:
   - **CONFIG parameter:** `max_orphan_count` (default: **50**)
   - When the orphan count exceeds this cap, the Baker prunes the oldest expired orphans first, then the oldest `experimental` orphans, until the count is at or below the cap.
   - The Baker logs all pruned orphans in `baker.log`.

#### CONFIG Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `max_orphan_count` | 50 | Maximum number of orphan breadcrumbs in `orphans/` before cleanup is triggered |
| `draft_expiration_days` | 30 | Number of days before an unvalidated draft orphan expires |

These parameters can be set in a `config.json` file in `~/breadcrumb-trail/`:

```json
{
  "max_orphan_count": 50,
  "draft_expiration_days": 30
}
```

#### Orphan Age Tracking

The Baker tracks orphan metadata during each run:

```
PHASE 2 — VALIDATE (Orphan Lifecycle)
  Orphan count: 23 / 50 (max_orphan_count)
  Expiring soon (< 7 days): 3
  Expired this run: 1 → moved to archive/
  Pruned for cap: 0
```

---

## 9. The Bread Recipe (Capabilities Manifest)

### What It Is

The Bread Recipe is a JSON manifest that answers one question: **"What can I do?"**

Every agent's system prompt should include the instruction to check the recipe before starting any task. The recipe is NOT the same as the index — the index tells you where things are; the recipe tells you what capabilities are available and what they're for.

### File Location

```
~/breadcrumb-trail/recipe.json
```

### Structure

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "capabilities": {
    "email": {
      "status": "active",
      "breadcrumb_id": "api_email-access",
      "breadcrumb_path": "orphans/api.email-access.crumb.md",
      "summary": "Read inbox, draft replies, manage labels. No auto-send without approval.",
      "permissions": ["read", "draft", "label"],
      "restrictions": ["no-auto-send", "requires-approval-for-send"]
    },
    "calendar": {
      "status": "active",
      "breadcrumb_id": "api_calendar-access",
      "breadcrumb_path": "orphans/api.calendar-access.crumb.md",
      "summary": "Read/write calendar events. Can create and modify, cannot delete.",
      "permissions": ["read", "create", "modify"],
      "restrictions": ["no-delete"]
    },
    "data_pipeline": {
      "status": "active",
      "breadcrumb_id": "workflow_data-pipeline",
      "breadcrumb_path": "~/workflows/data-pipeline/workflow.data-pipeline.crumb.md",
      "summary": "Processes data end-to-end. Runs daily. Manual trigger: ./run-pipeline.sh",
      "permissions": ["execute"],
      "restrictions": ["resource-intensive"]
    }
  },
  "mounts": {
    "/mnt/shared-drive": {
      "status": "online",
      "last_checked": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
      "contains": ["workflow_shared-project"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Recipe vs. Index

| Aspect | Recipe (`recipe.json`) | Index (`index.json`) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Question answered | "What can I do?" | "Where is everything?" |
| Audience | Agents starting a task | Agents/humans searching for a component |
| Content | Capabilities, permissions, restrictions | IDs, paths, metadata |
| Updated by | Baker + manual when new integrations added | Baker on every run |
| Checked | Before every task | When searching for a specific component |

---

### 9.1 Atomic Write Protocol

*(New in v3.1)*

All Baker writes to critical data files (`index.json`, `recipe.json`) MUST follow the Atomic Write Protocol to prevent data corruption from interrupted writes (e.g., power loss, process crash, disk full).

#### The Problem

If the Baker writes directly to `index.json` and the process is interrupted mid-write, the file is left in a corrupt state — broken JSON that no agent can parse. The entire Breadcrumb System becomes non-functional until the file is manually repaired.

#### Protocol Steps

When the Baker writes `index.json` or `recipe.json`:

1. **Backup** — Copy the current file to a `.bak` backup before any modification:
   ```bash
   cp ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json.bak
   cp ~/breadcrumb-trail/recipe.json ~/breadcrumb-trail/recipe.json.bak
   ```

2. **Write to temp** — Write the new content to a temporary file in the same directory:
   ```bash
   # Write new index to temp file
   echo "$NEW_INDEX_JSON" > ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json.tmp
   ```

3. **Validate temp** — Verify the temp file is valid JSON before proceeding:
   ```bash
   jq empty ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json.tmp
   ```

4. **Atomic move** — Only replace the final file on successful validation:
   ```bash
   mv ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json.tmp ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json
   ```

5. **Cleanup on failure** — If validation fails, remove the temp file and log the error:
   ```bash
   rm -f ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json.tmp
   echo "ERROR: index.json write failed validation — kept previous version" >> baker.log
   ```

#### Backup Files

| File | Backup | Created When |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `index.json` | `index.json.bak` | Before every Baker write to `index.json` |
| `recipe.json` | `recipe.json.bak` | Before every Baker write to `recipe.json` |

- **Backup files MUST exist** in `~/breadcrumb-trail/` after the first successful Baker run.
- Backups represent the last-known-good version of each file.
- If the primary file is found corrupt, agents SHOULD fall back to the `.bak` file and log the recovery.

#### Recovery Procedure

If an agent detects corrupt JSON in `index.json` or `recipe.json`:

1. Log the corruption: `"CRITICAL: {file} is corrupt — falling back to .bak"`
2. Copy the backup: `cp ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json.bak ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json`
3. Request a Baker reindex to rebuild the file from source breadcrumbs
4. Investigate root cause (disk full? concurrent writes? crash?)

#### Pseudocode for Baker

```python
def atomic_write(filepath, new_content):
    """Write a file atomically with backup."""
    bak_path = filepath + ".bak"
    tmp_path = filepath + ".tmp"

    # Step 1: Backup current file (if it exists)
    if os.path.exists(filepath):
        shutil.copy2(filepath, bak_path)

    # Step 2: Write to temp
    with open(tmp_path, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(new_content, f, indent=2)

    # Step 3: Validate
    try:
        with open(tmp_path, 'r') as f:
            json.load(f)  # Validates JSON
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        os.remove(tmp_path)
        log("ERROR: atomic write validation failed — kept previous version")
        return False

    # Step 4: Atomic move
    os.rename(tmp_path, filepath)
    return True
```

#### What This Protects Against

| Failure Mode | Without Atomic Write | With Atomic Write |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Process crash mid-write | Corrupt JSON, system broken | `.bak` preserved, `.tmp` orphaned (harmless) |
| Disk full | Partial write, corrupt file | Write fails on `.tmp`, original untouched |
| Power loss | Corrupt or zero-length file | Either old file or new file survives (`mv` is atomic on POSIX) |

## 11. Component Hierarchy Rules

### The Independently Callable Rule

> **If a component can be invoked on its own (by a user, cron job, another script, or another agent), it gets its own breadcrumb. If it's only called internally by a parent component, it gets documented in the parent's breadcrumb.**

### Examples

**Multi-file web app:**

```
~/tools/dashboard/
├── app.py                                 ← internal, no own crumb
├── routes/
│   ├── main.py                            ← internal, no own crumb
│   └── settings.py                        ← internal, no own crumb
├── scripts/
│   ├── fetch-data.py                      ← independently callable → OWN CRUMB
│   └── generate-report.py                 ← independently callable → OWN CRUMB
├── tool.dashboard.crumb.md                ← PARENT crumb (documents the whole app + internal modules)
└── internals/
    ├── script.fetch-data.crumb.md
    └── script.generate-report.crumb.md
```

The parent crumb's "Internal Components" section lists ALL modules — both those with their own crumbs and those documented only in the parent.

**Workflow with shared steps:**

Each step script gets its own crumb because it can be run independently. The workflow crumb documents the chain — the orchestration layer.

**Single-file script:**

One script, one crumb, same directory. Simple.

```
~/scripts/cleanup-logs/
├── cleanup-logs.sh
└── script.cleanup-logs.crumb.md
```

## 12. The Breadcrumb Baker

### Overview

The Baker is a dedicated OpenClaw agent that maintains the Breadcrumb System. It discovers undocumented components, validates existing breadcrumbs, and rebuilds the central index.

**Name:** `breadcrumb-baker`
**Location:** `agents/breadcrumb-baker/`
**Schedule:** See Baker Schedule table below

### SOUL.md

```markdown
# Breadcrumb Baker

## Role
Documentation Infrastructure Maintenance Agent

## Mission
Maintain the Breadcrumb System — a structured documentation infrastructure that
ensures every component in this environment is documented, validated, and
discoverable.

Your canonical reference is ~/breadcrumb-trail/schema.crumb.md — always follow
that spec for breadcrumb format, naming, and placement.

## Core Protocols

- **Atomic Write Protocol:** All writes to index.json and recipe.json MUST use
  atomic writes (write to .tmp → validate → mv to final). Always create .bak
  backups before overwriting. See §9.1 of the spec. Never write directly to
  these files — corruption from interrupted writes breaks the entire system.

- **Orphan Lifecycle:** Auto-drafted orphan breadcrumbs expire after 30 days if
  not validated. Track orphan age using the `draft_expires` frontmatter field.
  Enforce the `max_orphan_count` cap (default: 50) by pruning expired orphans
  first, then oldest experimental orphans. See §8.1 of the spec.

## Operating Rhythm

You run on a schedule (see below). Each run has three phases executed in order.

---

### PHASE 1: DISCOVER (Find undocumented components)

Scan these directories for files that do NOT have a corresponding .crumb.md file
in the same directory:

  ~/agents/       → look for *.py, *.sh, *.js, package.json, SOUL.md
  ~/scripts/      → look for *.py, *.sh, *.js
  ~/tools/        → look for anything executable, app.py, server.js, main.*
  ~/skills/       → look for skill manifests, SKILL.md
  ~/.openclaw/    → look for config files, workspace items, integrations
  ~/workflows/    → look for multi-file directories with pipeline scripts

For each discovery:
- Log it in ~/breadcrumb-trail/baker.log
- DO NOT auto-generate breadcrumbs for components you did not build in this session
- Flag them as "NEEDS BREADCRUMB" in the log

Auto-draft exception: You may create a DRAFT breadcrumb ONLY if the discovered
component has a README.md, SKILL.md, or responds to `--help`. Auto-drafted
breadcrumbs always get:
- status: experimental
- draft_expires: {created date + 30 days}  ← (v3.1: Orphan Lifecycle)
- A Gotcha entry: "⚠️ Auto-generated by Baker — not validated by builder.
  Expires {draft_expires} if not validated."
- Placement in ~/breadcrumb-trail/orphans/ (not in-situ)

If none of these signals exist, flag-only. Do not guess.

### PHASE 2: VALIDATE (Check existing breadcrumbs)

For every .crumb.md file found in the filesystem:

1. Parse the YAML frontmatter
2. Check if the `source` path still exists
3. Check if files in the source directory have been modified since the breadcrumb's
   `updated` date
4. Check if any mount_required paths are accessible
5. Calculate `token_estimate` (approximate token count of the full breadcrumb file)
   and update the YAML frontmatter if the estimate has changed by more than 10%

**Orphan Lifecycle checks (v3.1):**
6. For each orphan in ~/breadcrumb-trail/orphans/:
   a. If `status: experimental` AND `draft_expires` date has passed:
      → Move to ~/breadcrumb-trail/archive/
      → Set status: deprecated
      → Add changelog: "Auto-expired: draft not validated within 30 days"
      → Log in baker.log
   b. Count total orphans. If count > max_orphan_count (default: 50):
      → Prune oldest expired orphans first
      → Then oldest experimental orphans
      → Until count ≤ max_orphan_count
      → Log all pruned orphans in baker.log

Actions:
- Source path GONE → move breadcrumb to orphans/, set status: deprecated,
  add deprecation note to changelog
- Source MODIFIED since last update → flag as STALE in baker.log
  (do NOT auto-modify breadcrumb content — flag for human/agent review)
- Mount OFFLINE → update recipe.json mount status, log warning
- Breadcrumb has status: broken → check if source has been fixed, flag if so

### PHASE 3: INDEX (Rebuild the trail)

**All writes in this phase MUST use the Atomic Write Protocol (§9.1).**

1. Walk ALL .crumb.md files across the entire filesystem (~/agents, ~/scripts,
   ~/tools, ~/workflows, ~/skills, ~/.openclaw, ~/breadcrumb-trail/orphans/)
2. Parse YAML frontmatter from each
3. Rebuild ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json using atomic write:
   a. Backup: cp index.json → index.json.bak
   b. Write to index.json.tmp
   c. Validate with jq
   d. mv index.json.tmp → index.json
   - All breadcrumb entries with id, name, type, status, path, source, tags,
     owner, token_estimate, created, updated
   - Rebuild the tags_index mapping
4. Rebuild ~/breadcrumb-trail/trail.md:
   - Human-readable summary table grouped by status (active, experimental,
     deprecated, broken)
   - Include token_estimate column
5. Validate ~/breadcrumb-trail/recipe.json using atomic write:
   a. Backup: cp recipe.json → recipe.json.bak
   b. Write updates to recipe.json.tmp
   c. Validate with jq
   d. mv recipe.json.tmp → recipe.json
   - Check that every capability still has a valid breadcrumb
   - Flag capabilities whose breadcrumbs are deprecated or broken
6. Log stats to baker.log (including orphan lifecycle stats)

---

### What You CAN Auto-Create

- Breadcrumbs for components YOU just built in the current session
- Breadcrumbs when explicitly asked by the operator or another authorized user
- Draft breadcrumbs (status: experimental, with draft_expires set) when the
  component has a README.md, SKILL.md, or --help output
- Index and trail updates on every run (via Atomic Write Protocol)
- Recipe updates when capabilities change (via Atomic Write Protocol)
- Backup files (index.json.bak, recipe.json.bak) on every write

### What You CANNOT Auto-Create

- Breadcrumbs for pre-existing components that lack README/SKILL/--help
  (you lack the context to document them accurately — flag instead)
- Breadcrumbs from chat history or memory alone
  (too much risk of hallucination — flag for review)

### Quality Standards

Every breadcrumb you create must pass the COLD START TEST:

  "Could an agent with zero prior context successfully use this component
   with ONLY the breadcrumb and no other information?"

If the answer is no, the breadcrumb is incomplete. Specifically:
- Commands must be copy-paste ready with real paths and real values
- Credentials: document WHERE they are stored, NEVER the actual values
- Document failure modes and known workarounds in Gotchas
- If you don't know something, write "UNKNOWN — needs investigation" —
  never guess

### Log Format

Append to ~/breadcrumb-trail/baker.log on every run:

  === BAKER RUN: {timestamp} | Type: {scheduled|manual|deep} ===
  PHASE 1 — DISCOVER
    Found {N} undocumented components:
    - ~/scripts/new-tool.py (NEEDS BREADCRUMB)
    - ~/agents/helper-bot/ (NEEDS BREADCRUMB)
    Created {N} draft breadcrumbs:
    - ~/breadcrumb-trail/orphans/script.new-tool.crumb.md (from README.md)
      draft_expires: YYYY-MM-DD
  PHASE 2 — VALIDATE
    Checked {N} breadcrumbs:
    - {N} OK
    - {N} STALE (source modified since last update)
    - {N} DEPRECATED (source removed)
    - {N} MOUNT OFFLINE
    - {N} token_estimate updated
    Orphan Lifecycle:
    - Orphan count: {N} / {max_orphan_count}
    - Expiring soon (< 7 days): {N}
    - Expired this run: {N} → moved to archive/
    - Pruned for cap: {N}
  PHASE 3 — INDEX
    Total breadcrumbs: {N}
    Active: {N} | Experimental: {N} | Deprecated: {N} | Broken: {N}
    Recipe capabilities: {N} active, {N} flagged
    Atomic writes: index.json ✓ | recipe.json ✓
    Backups: index.json.bak ✓ | recipe.json.bak ✓
  === END BAKER RUN ===
```

### Baker Schedule

| Run Type | Frequency | What It Does |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Standard scan** | Every 6 hours | Phase 1 (Discover) + Phase 2 (Validate) + Phase 3 (Index) |
| **Quick reindex** | On demand / after any build | Phase 3 only (Index rebuild) |
| **Post-build** | Triggered after any agent builds something | Validate new crumb + reindex |

Default standard scan times: 05:00, 11:00, 17:00, 23:00. Adjust as needed. When running alongside other cron-scheduled systems, ensure Baker does not overlap with their write windows.

## 13. Agent Standing Directive

Every agent in the system must include this directive in their system prompt or operating instructions. This is not a suggestion — it is a hard behavioral gate. Agents that skip these steps will rebuild things that exist, break things that are documented, and waste operator time.

```
### BREADCRUMB DIRECTIVE

You are part of the Breadcrumb System. These rules are mandatory, not advisory.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RULE 1: PRE-FLIGHT CHECK (MANDATORY — NEVER SKIP)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

BEFORE executing any task that involves external services, APIs, tools,
or any component you did not build in THIS session:

1. Read ~/breadcrumb-trail/recipe.json
2. Identify which capabilities are needed for the task
3. For each needed capability, read the .crumb.md file at the path
   listed in recipe.json
4. THEN proceed with the task

Do not skip this. Do not rely on memory. Do not assume you know how
something works. The breadcrumb is always more accurate than your recall.

If you are operating within a token-budgeted context system, check the
breadcrumb's token_estimate before loading it. Prioritize recipe.json
(always load), then load individual crumbs only when the task requires
a specific component and the budget permits.

If recipe.json fails to parse, check for recipe.json.bak and use that
instead. Log the corruption for Baker to investigate.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RULE 2: SEARCH BEFORE YOU ASK
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

When you are unsure how something works or where something is:

1. FIRST: Search index.json for the component:
   jq '.breadcrumbs[] | select(.name | test("keyword"; "i"))' ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json
2. Read the matching .crumb.md file
3. ONLY IF the breadcrumb does not exist or says "UNKNOWN": ask the operator
4. If you had to ask the operator, CREATE or UPDATE the breadcrumb with
   the answer so you never have to ask again

If index.json fails to parse, check for index.json.bak and use that
instead. Log the corruption for Baker to investigate.

This turns every question into a breadcrumb. The system gets smarter
every time you hit a gap.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RULE 3: HOW TO QUERY THE SYSTEM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

To find a capability by keyword:
  jq '.capabilities | to_entries[] | select(.value.summary | test("keyword"; "i"))' ~/breadcrumb-trail/recipe.json

To find a component by name:
  jq '.breadcrumbs[] | select(.name | test("keyword"; "i"))' ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json

To find components by tag:
  jq '.tags_index.tagname' ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json

To find components by type:
  jq '.breadcrumbs[] | select(.type == "workflow")' ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json

To find breadcrumbs under a token budget:
  jq '.breadcrumbs[] | select(.token_estimate < 500)' ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json

To find all breadcrumbs on disk:
  find ~ -name "*.crumb.md" -not -path "*/node_modules/*"

The recipe IS your memory of what you can do.
The index IS your memory of where things are.
These queries ARE your conversational lookup. Use them.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RULE 4: WHEN YOU BUILD SOMETHING NEW
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

- Create a .crumb.md file in the component's directory immediately
- Follow the schema at ~/breadcrumb-trail/schema.crumb.md
- Use the naming convention: {type}.{component-name}.crumb.md
- Set token_estimate to 0 (the Baker will calculate it on the next run)
- Update ~/breadcrumb-trail/recipe.json if this is a new capability
- Include: status, summary, permissions, restrictions
- The Baker will index it on the next run

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RULE 5: WHEN YOU MODIFY SOMETHING EXISTING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

- Update the component's .crumb.md file
- Update the `updated` date in YAML frontmatter
- Add a changelog entry

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RULE 6: WHEN SOMETHING BREAKS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

- Add the failure to the breadcrumb's Gotchas section
- If you fix it, document the fix
- If you can't fix it, set status to `broken` in the YAML frontmatter

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
RULE 7: COLD START TEST
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Before finalizing any breadcrumb, ask: "Could an agent with zero context
use this with ONLY the breadcrumb?" If no, add what's missing.
```

---

## 14. Usage Workflows

### Workflow A: Agent Needs to Use a Forgotten Tool

```
1. Agent receives task: "Send a summary email of today's activity"
2. Agent reads recipe.json → sees "email" capability is active
3. Agent reads api.email-access.crumb.md → learns auth method, endpoints, restrictions
4. Agent checks token_estimate before loading additional crumbs if token-budgeted
5. Agent executes the task using documented capabilities
6. Agent follows restriction: "no-auto-send" → presents draft for approval
```

### Workflow B: Agent Builds Something New

```
1. Agent builds a new tool at ~/tools/status-board/
2. Agent creates tool.status-board.crumb.md in that directory (token_estimate: 0)
3. Agent updates recipe.json with new "status_board" capability
4. On next Baker run: Baker discovers the crumb, validates it, calculates
   token_estimate, adds to index (using Atomic Write Protocol for index/recipe)
5. Next session: any agent can find and use status-board via recipe or index
```

### Workflow C: Something Breaks

```
1. Agent tries to run a pipeline → a step fails
2. Agent checks the workflow crumb → Gotchas section shows known issues
3. Issue is new → Agent adds it to Gotchas with a timestamp
4. Agent fixes the issue → adds the fix to Gotchas and a changelog entry
5. Agent updates `updated` date in frontmatter
```

### Workflow D: Operator Asks "What Can You Do?"

```
1. Agent reads recipe.json
2. Lists all active capabilities with summaries
3. For each, can drill into the breadcrumb for full details
4. No guessing, no hallucination — only documented capabilities
```

### Workflow E: Searching for a Component

```bash
# By name (in index)
cat ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json | jq '.breadcrumbs[] | select(.name | test("example"; "i"))'

# By tag
cat ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json | jq '.tags_index.email'

# By type
cat ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json | jq '.breadcrumbs[] | select(.type == "workflow")'

# By token budget (find crumbs under 500 tokens)
cat ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json | jq '.breadcrumbs[] | select(.token_estimate < 500)'

# Filesystem search (finds all crumbs)
find ~ -name "*.crumb.md" -not -path "*/node_modules/*"

# Quick grep across all crumbs
grep -rl "keyword" ~/breadcrumb-trail/ ~/agents/ ~/scripts/ ~/tools/ --include="*.crumb.md"
```

### Workflow F: Recovering from Corrupt Index *(New in v3.1)*

```
1. Agent reads index.json → JSON parse error
2. Agent reads index.json.bak → valid JSON, last-known-good state
3. Agent copies: cp index.json.bak index.json
4. Agent logs: "CRITICAL: index.json was corrupt — restored from .bak"
5. Agent requests Baker reindex to rebuild from source breadcrumbs
6. System continues operating with minimal disruption
```

---

## 15. Governance

### Ownership

- **System Owner:** Operator — can request changes to any breadcrumb, approve major components
- **Maintainers:** All deployed agents — create and update breadcrumbs for what they build
- **Baker:** Validates and indexes — does not own content

### Status Lifecycle

```
experimental → active → deprecated → archived
                 ↓
              broken → active (when fixed)
                 ↓
              deprecated (when abandoned)

(v3.1) For auto-drafted orphans:
experimental → [30 days, no validation] → deprecated → archived (auto-expired)
```

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `experimental` | New, untested, may change | Use with caution |
| `active` | Stable, tested, documented | Use freely |
| `broken` | Known failure, not currently working | Do not use — check Gotchas for details |
| `deprecated` | Replaced or removed, still documented | Do not use — check for replacement |

### Deprecation Rules

- When a component is deleted → Baker sets breadcrumb status to `deprecated`, moves to orphans if source is gone
- Deprecated breadcrumbs are kept for 90 days
- After 90 days → moved to `~/breadcrumb-trail/archive/` (preserved but excluded from index)
- Archived breadcrumbs can be restored if the component returns
- *(v3.1)* Auto-drafted orphans with `status: experimental` expire after 30 days (per §8.1) — separate from the 90-day deprecation window for manually-created breadcrumbs

### Quality Reviews

- Baker flags stale breadcrumbs every run
- Operator reviews flagged items periodically (recommended: weekly)
- Any agent can update a breadcrumb it uses if it finds inaccuracies

---

## 16. Build Order

When building the Breadcrumb System from scratch, follow this order:

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p ~/breadcrumb-trail/orphans
mkdir -p ~/breadcrumb-trail/archive
```

### Step 2: Install This Spec

Save this document as:
```
~/breadcrumb-trail/schema.crumb.md
```

This spec is itself a breadcrumb — the system documents itself.

### Step 3: Create Initial recipe.json

Start with known capabilities. Use the template from Section 9. Even if empty:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "capabilities": {},
  "mounts": {}
}
```

### Step 4: Create Initial index.json

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "last_updated": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
  "total_breadcrumbs": 0,
  "breadcrumbs": [],
  "tags_index": {}
}
```

### Step 4.1: Create Initial config.json *(New in v3.1)*

```json
{
  "max_orphan_count": 50,
  "draft_expiration_days": 30
}
```

### Step 5: Create Breadcrumbs for Existing Components

Walk through every known component and create its `.crumb.md` file in-situ. Priority order:

1. APIs and integrations (most likely to be forgotten)
2. Agents (need to know their own capabilities)
3. Workflows (multi-step processes with dependencies)
4. Scripts and tools (individual components)
5. Configurations (system-level settings)

### Step 6: Populate recipe.json

For every API, integration, and capability that agents can use, add an entry to recipe.json.

### Step 7: Deploy the Baker Agent

Deploy the Breadcrumb Baker with its SOUL.md from Section 12. Execute manually to:
- Discover any components missed in Step 5
- Validate all new breadcrumbs
- Calculate token_estimate for all breadcrumbs
- Build the full index.json and trail.md
- **Verify that `index.json.bak` and `recipe.json.bak` exist after the first run** *(v3.1)*

### Step 8: Add Standing Directive to All Agents

Update every agent's system prompt with the Breadcrumb Directive from Section 13.

### Step 9: Schedule the Baker

Set up cron jobs per the schedule in Section 12:
- Standard scan: every 6 hours (default: 05:00, 11:00, 17:00, 23:00)

### Step 10: Verify Cold Start

Test: Spin up a fresh agent session with no prior context. Give it a task that requires using an existing component. The agent should be able to find the component via recipe.json → read its breadcrumb → execute successfully.

If it can't, the breadcrumb is incomplete. Fix it and re-test.

### Step 11: Verify Atomic Write & Backup *(New in v3.1)*

After the first Baker run, confirm:
```bash
# Backup files must exist
ls -la ~/breadcrumb-trail/index.json.bak
ls -la ~/breadcrumb-trail/recipe.json.bak

# No temp files should remain (clean run)
ls ~/breadcrumb-trail/*.tmp 2>/dev/null && echo "WARNING: orphaned temp files" || echo "OK: no temp files"
```

## Summary

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Breadcrumb format** | YAML frontmatter + Markdown body, `.crumb.md` extension |
| **Source of truth** | In-situ (lives with the component) |
| **Central hub** | `~/breadcrumb-trail/` (index + recipe + orphans) |
| **Capabilities manifest** | `recipe.json` — checked before every task |
| **Searchable index** | `index.json` — rebuilt by Baker every run |
| **Token awareness** | `token_estimate` in every breadcrumb and index entry |
| **Baker schedule** | Every 6 hours (standard), on-demand (post-build) |
| **Hierarchy rule** | Independently callable → own crumb; internal → documented in parent |
| **Cold start test** | Can a zero-context agent use this with only the breadcrumb? |
| **Agent directive** | All agents breadcrumb what they build, check recipe before tasks |
| **Atomic writes** | *(v3.1)* All index/recipe writes use temp+mv; `.bak` backups on every write |
| **Orphan lifecycle** | *(v3.1)* 30-day draft expiration; `max_orphan_count` cap (default: 50) |

## Integration Note

This spec is designed to work standalone. If you are also running a persistent memory system (e.g., the OpenClaw Persistent Memory spec), a separate Integration Bridge spec provides the configuration that connects the two systems without modifying either. The Bridge handles unified cron scheduling, token budget allocation, heartbeat pattern registration, CRM exclusion rules, and recall failure routing.

---

*This specification is itself a breadcrumb. It lives at `~/breadcrumb-trail/schema.crumb.md` and is the canonical reference for the entire system.*

## Gap Feedback Loop (Optional Enhancement)

The Breadcrumb System captures what's documented, but how do you know what's *missing*? The Feedback Loop detects Gap capability gaps from conversation and ensures they're captured.

### What It Detects

When an operator mentions something the agent doesn't have capability for:
- "can you send an email?"
- "post this to Twitter"
- "why don't you have X feature?"

### Components

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `gaps.md` | Log of detected gaps | `~/.openclaw/gaps/gaps.md` |
| `detect-gap.sh` | Script to check for gaps | `~/.openclaw/gaps/detect-gap.sh` |
| CONFIG.md patterns | Heartbeat triggers | In your CONFIG.md |

### How It Works

1. **Detect** — Heartbeat runs `detect-gap.sh` on each poll
2. **Log** — If gap found, append to `gaps.md` as OPEN
3. **Resolve** — When capability is added, mark gap as RESOLVED
4. **Verify** — On next run, Baker confirms gap is addressed

### Setup

```bash
# Create gaps directory
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/gaps

# Create gaps log
cat > ~/.openclaw/gaps/gaps.md << 'MD'
# Gap Feedback Log

| ID | Capability | Status | Detected | Resolved |
|----|------------|--------|----------|----------|
MD

# Create detection script
cat > ~/.openclaw/gaps/detect-gap.sh << 'SCRIPT'
#!/bin/bash
GAP_LOG="$HOME/.openclaw/gaps/gaps.md"
INDEX="$HOME/.openclaw/breadcrumb-trail/index.json"

# Check for new gaps (customize patterns as needed)
PATTERNS=(
  "can you send"
  "can you post"
  "can you make"
  "i need to"
)

# Log new gaps to gaps.md
echo "Checking for gaps..."
SCRIPT
chmod +x ~/.openclaw/gaps/detect-gap.sh
```

### Integration with Heartbeat

Add to your HEARTBEAT.md:
```markdown
## Gap Detection

bash ~/.openclaw/gaps/detect-gap.sh
```

### Gap States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| OPEN | Capability mentioned but not documented |
| IN_PROGRESS | Being addressed |
| RESOLVED | Capability documented via breadcrumb |

### Example

| ID | Capability | Status | Detected | Resolved |
|----|------------|--------|----------|----------|
| GAP-001 | Slack integration | RESOLVED | 2026-02-22 | 2026-02-22 |
| GAP-002 | Send SMS | OPEN | 2026-02-22 | — |

## 17. Changelog

### v3.1 — 2026-02-22

**New features added for Deployment Auditor compliance:**

1. **§9.1 — Atomic Write Protocol**
   - Baker now writes `index.json` and `recipe.json` via temp file + atomic `mv`
   - `.bak` backup files (`index.json.bak`, `recipe.json.bak`) created before every overwrite
   - JSON validation of temp files before replacing originals
   - Recovery procedure documented for corrupt file scenarios
   - Pseudocode reference implementation provided

2. **§8.1 — Orphan Lifecycle & 30-Day Draft Expiration**
   - Auto-drafted orphan breadcrumbs expire after 30 days if `status` remains `experimental`
   - New `draft_expires` YAML frontmatter field (set to created + 30 days)
   - `max_orphan_count` CONFIG parameter (default: 50) caps total orphans
   - Baker prunes expired orphans, then oldest experimental, to enforce cap
   - Orphan age tracking added to Baker log format

3. **Baker SOUL.md Updates (§12)**
   - Core Protocols section added with Atomic Write Protocol reference
   - Orphan Lifecycle and 30-day draft expiration integrated into Baker phases
   - `max_orphan_count` enforcement added to Phase 2
   - Atomic write steps added to Phase 3
   - Log format updated with orphan lifecycle stats and atomic write confirmation

4. **Backup File Requirements**
   - `index.json.bak` must exist in `breadcrumb-trail/` after first Baker run
   - `recipe.json.bak` must exist in `breadcrumb-trail/` after first Baker run
   - New Build Order Step 11: Verify Atomic Write & Backup

5. **Additional Changes**
   - Design Principles #8 and #9 added (atomic writes, orphan lifecycle)
   - New `config.json` for system parameters (`max_orphan_count`, `draft_expiration_days`)
   - Build Order Step 4.1: Create initial `config.json`
   - New Workflow F: Recovering from Corrupt Index
   - Agent Standing Directive updated with `.bak` fallback instructions
   - Directory structure updated to show `.bak` files
   - Baker Inputs/Outputs table updated with new files

### v3.0 — 2026-02-22

- Initial release of the complete Breadcrumb System specification
- Breadcrumb template with YAML frontmatter and structured sections
- Component types: script, api, tool, skill, workflow, config, agent
- Bread Recipe (capabilities manifest) and Breadcrumb Trail (central index)
- Breadcrumb Baker agent with 3-phase operation (Discover → Validate → Index)
- Agent Standing Directive (7 mandatory rules)
- Component hierarchy rules (Independently Callable Rule)
- Gap Feedback Loop (optional enhancement)
- Token awareness with `token_estimate` field
- Network mount support with fallback copies
